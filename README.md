# printf  Project

## Description


This is a team project, and is part of ALX first year curriculum. The main task is to replicate the C standard library printf() function.

Printf function produces output depending on the variable types and the format of output you want it to produce. These includes:
* •	%c: Prints a single character.
* •	%s: Prints a string of characters.
* •	%d: Prints integers.
* •	%i: Prints integers.
* •	%b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
* •	%u: Prints unsigned integers
* •	%X: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters
* •	%r: Prints a reversed string

## Prototype 

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

##Usage 

* •	Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
* •	All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
* •	Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters

## Examples

* •	_printf("Hello, main\n") prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line
* •	_printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"
* •	_printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"
